# UAS_Elda_FS

Major Progress No 1 Notes:
- 18/06 Finished a MATLAB code to help tune the PI gain (with the prerequisite of the transfer function model correctly derived)

Major Progress No 2 Notes:
- 21/06 determined the specs of PV, then choosing between potential semiconductor devices
- 22/06 Finished 3 days arrangement of first draft circuit of No 2, unable to control PQ but able to control current using PI controller, so its now able to make leading and lagging current using dq frame current control logic
