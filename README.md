Major Progress No 1 Notes:
- 14/06 Finished open loop buck converter schematics 
- 14/06 Finished a MATLAB code to help tune the PI gain (with the prerequisite of the transfer function model correctly derived), will upload it later if there are modifications
- 15/06 Finished closed loop buck converter schematics

Major Progress No 2 Notes:
- 21/06 determined the specs of PV, then choosing between potential semiconductor devices
- 22/06 Finished 3 days arrangement of first draft circuit of No 2, unable to control PQ but able to control current using PI controller, so its now able to make leading and lagging current using dq frame current control logic
- 25/06 After about 3 days of learning the solar panel schematic and another 3 days of building the required circuit for no 2, finally it can control the power or current in dq frame
